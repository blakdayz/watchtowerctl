Feature: In Memory - Runtime Active Incident Response Agents
  Given that the input and output subsystems of modern computers is a
  target of malicious acts against free and stable operations,
  When a threat from the outside target our systems, we must respond
  in a way that keeps the system available for use and denies those
  who threaten it the ability to freely operate without control.
  Then we implement strategies and scenarios aligned to the side of peace
  and stability.
  When a technology intends to threaten peace, it first must must control
  the input and output to those who would learn of it and prevent it.
  Given we have the technology to coordinate, document, observe, collect
  evidence and build a state of peace,
  When an agent must perform an action, it must be assured the subsystem
  the action arrives on is safe.
  Given the current operational model of the MacOS, the IO Kit framework
  is used currently, with the other frameworks to develop software that
  can run as signed and affect the user environment.
  When this is the case, we must investigate all processes for conformity
  to non-abusive behavior.
  Given the threading model of modern computation this means we must be
  able to inject without reason into attacking objects when suspicious
  and perform intrusive analysis and be the determination of execution
  olr not.
  When an offender is found, we copy the state of that object into a vectorized
  database and trim the attack frequency graph of vectors in memory
  Given that we are root at console
  When we work together we can delete the offending root cause code and
  return peace to the subsystems of computation.
